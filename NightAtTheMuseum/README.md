# Night at the Museum

## Notes on the process

### Purpose
The purpose of Night at the Museum is to help people understand the different use cases of VR. It does this by showcases those topics from within a VR experience. Users are transformed to different settings that each focus on a different flavor of the industry. This project covers several topics. It includes:

* Journalism
* Social VR
* Virtual Tourism
* Architecture
* Medical
* Gaming
* Storytelling


### Persona
The persona for this project was very similar to the first term 2 project, but this time, the idea is to focus on someone who is interested in VR and wants to dive deeper into what it could be used for. This idea was still that this should be designed for a relative beginner and should take extra care in making sure this person has a comfortable, engaging experience. The intent of the project is to help make a good impression for VR in general and help provide a good overview of various aspects of the industry.

### Concept & Grayboxing
The first step was to setup the project, and get the basic mechanic working. For this experience, there will need to be clickable elements that will need to take the user to an immersive scene. From within the immersive scene, the user will see images, hear audio, and read text to provide educational content.

To kick off the project, I got some basic working elements put together before implemented a full environment. Once that stuff was working, I deployed to my phone.
