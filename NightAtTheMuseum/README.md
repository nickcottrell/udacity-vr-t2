# Night at the Museum

## Notes on the process

### Purpose
The purpose of Night at the Museum is to help people understand the different use cases of VR. It does this by showcases those topics from within a VR experience. Users are transformed to different settings that each focus on a different flavor of the industry. This project covers several topics. It includes:

* Journalism
* Social VR
* Virtual Tourism
* Architecture
* Medical

### Persona
The persona for this project was very similar to the first term 2 project, but this time, the idea is to focus on someone who is interested in VR and wants to dive deeper into what it could be used for. This idea was still that this should be designed for a relative beginner and should take extra care in making sure this person has a comfortable, engaging experience. The intent of the project is to help make a good impression for VR in general and help provide a good overview of various aspects of the industry.

### Concept & Grayboxing
The first step was to setup the project, and get the basic mechanic working. For this experience, there will need to be clickable elements that will need to take the user to an immersive scene. From within the immersive scene, the user will see images, hear audio, and read text to provide educational content.

To kick off the project, I got some basic working elements put together before implemented a full environment. Once that stuff was working, I deployed to my phone.

### Conceptual Art
Some ideas about the concept art and approach for the environments and UI.


### User Testing
After I got a graybox prototype complete, I completed a user test. The test was to drop the user in a basic lobby and have them click on the various booths to enter each photosphere. The basic idea was to get insights about navigation, layout and general feel of the direction.

### Lessons Learned from User Testing
During the first round of user testing, I got the following feedback.
* "It made me dizzy when I looked down and didn't see a solid floor"...referring to 360 photosphere
* "How do I get back to the lobby?"

Based on that, I decided to make the following changes:
* Add a consistent solid ground to the 360 photoshperes
* Adjust the position of the back button so it's visible on load

### Adding the theme
To create this theme, I combined the following Asset bundles:
* Asset Bundle
