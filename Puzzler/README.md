## Notes on the process

### Persona
Developed a rough persona to map to this project. The idea is that this should be designed for a relative beginner and should take extra care in making sure this person has a comfortable, engaging experience. This project should help make a good impression for VR in general as well as for the game itself.

### Getting Started
The first thing I did was opened the starter project, got everything up and running properly. I deployed to my phone and verified that it deployed properly.

### Grayboxing
The idea here is to get all working elements working before I actually decide on a theme and or polish the elements. First, I want to make sure the game works with the timing. By keeping all elements basic and non-styled, I am able to focus on the basic interactions and timing.

### Conceptual Art
Before actually applying the art to the scene, I want to look a couple of different variations based on the art that I will have access to in the Unity Asset Store. I put together some moodboards on some possible themes. When I do the first round of user testing, I'll use the moodboards to guage interest from others to helpe determine which theme I might go with.

### User Testing
After I have a working graybox prototype and art theme moodboards, I am now ready to do a round of user tests. The main thing I'm trying to guage is interest in the art and story as well as get feedback from the general mechanics, timing and scale of the game.

### Second Pass
After the first round of user testing, I want to make a few improvements based on the feedback.
