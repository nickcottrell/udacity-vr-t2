This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3
- GVR Unity SDK v1.60.0
- iTween v2.0.7

## Notes on the process

### Persona
Developed a rough persona to map to this project. The idea is that this should be designed for a relative beginner and should take extra care in making sure this person has a comfortable, engaging experience. This project should help make a good impression for VR in general as well as for the game itself.

### Getting Started
The first thing I did was opened the starter project, got everything up and running properly. I deployed to my phone and verified that it deployed properly.

### Grayboxing
The idea here is to get all working elements working before I actually decide on a theme and or polish the elements. First, I want to make sure the game works with the timing. By keeping all elements basic and non-styled, I am able to focus on the basic interactions and timing.

### Conceptual Art
Before actually applying the art to the scene, I want to look a couple of different variations based on the art that I will have access to in the Unity Asset Store. I put together some moodboards on some possible themes. When I do the first round of user testing, I'll use the moodboards to guage interest from others to helpe determine which theme I might go with.

### User Testing
After I have a working graybox prototype and art theme moodboards, I am now ready to do a round of user tests. The main thing I'm trying to guage is interest in the art and story as well as get feedback from the general mechanics, timing and scale of the game.

### Lessons Learned from User Testing
After the first round of user testing, I got the following feedback.
* feedback one
* feedback two
* feedback three

Based on that, I decided to make the following changes:
* change one
* change two
* change three

Overall, I think the user testing provided insight and will help me create a better game.

### Adding the theme
Based on the input from the user testing, I think this theme will work the best. To create this theme, I combined the following Asset bundles.

From there I used X, Y and Z pieces to help tell the story.

Once the main art was in place, I made sure everything worked and was performant on my phone.

I made this performance tweak based on the initial run.

Next I developed the designs for the UI canvas elements. I used X, Y, and Z elements to incorporate the theme.
