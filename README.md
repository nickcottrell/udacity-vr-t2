# Udacity VR Developer Course - Term 2
Projects completed during Udacity VR Course Term 2. During this course, I learned about the fundamentals of VR design. The course covered ergonomics, user testing, and interface design, and established a generalized, repeatable process to approach any VR design task. The course provided an overview from industry professionals about the current state of the VR industry and the future of Mixed Reality.

## Puzzler
Puzzler is a game designed for new VR users to get a sense for basic gaze-based controls. The purpose is to have a comfortable user experience and hopefully a positive impression on VR as a way of experiencing media. The game involves a "simon" mechanic where the player must repeat a sequence that they see appear with light and sound. I put my own spin on the game by inventing a story line. In the story, the alien ship crashed and the pattern game is their way of communicating. By communicating with the Aliens, the player saves the world and wins the game.

## Night at the Museum
The purpose of Night at the Museum is to help people understand the different use cases of VR. It does this by showcases those topics from within a VR experience. Users are transformed to different settings that each focus on a different flavor of the industry. The idea is to provide an immersive, engaging and performant experience. Also since VR covers so many items, the intent is that the information is presented in a clear and consistent manner. Hopefully users will come away from this experience with a more broad sense of how VR can be useful--It's not just about games!
